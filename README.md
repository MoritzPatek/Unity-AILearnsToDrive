### AI learning to drive
so for my next AI project I wanted to try something simple yet cool

## What is that project about:
I will create one of my first real AIs that can actually do some stuff and not only calculate numbers

## How will it work:
- I will throw a ton of cars into a inviroment with a few walls.
- Every car will have a neural network that has 7 inputs and 4 outputs and some hidden layers
- with the help of nice algorithmens like backpropagation and sigmoid we can then create a usefull neural network that can actually drive through the given course.
