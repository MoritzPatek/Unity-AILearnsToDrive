### AI learning to drive
- so for my next AI project i wanted to try something simple yet cool to programm

## What is that project about:
- I create one of my first real life AIs that can actually do some stuff and not only calculate numbers

## How will it work:
- i will throw a ton of cars into a inviroment with a view walls.
- Every car will have a neural network that has 7 inputs and 4 outputs
- with the help of nice algorithmens like backpropagation and sigmoid we can then create a usefull neural network 
- that can actually drive through the given course.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
